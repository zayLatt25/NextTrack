## üßÆ Scoring Algorithm

The recommendation system uses a balanced multi-factor scoring approach that prioritizes track similarity and user preferences:

1. **Track Similarity** (Weight: 2, capped) - **Highest Priority**
   - Artist similarity matching (50% weight)
   - Title similarity scoring (30% weight)
   - Popularity similarity (20% weight)
   - Compares against all selected reference tracks
   - Maximum contribution: 2 points

2. **Genre Matching** (Weight: 3)
   - Matches against genres extracted from selected tracks
   - Auto-extracts genres from artist metadata
   - Rewards tracks with matching genres

3. **Mood-based Scoring** (Weight: 3)
   - Genre matching based on mood preferences
   - Popularity range matching for mood context
   - Mood-specific genre and popularity combinations

4. **Context Awareness** (Weight: 2)
   - Time of day scoring (60% weight)
   - Activity-based scoring (40% weight)
   - Considers morning/afternoon/evening/night preferences
   - Matches workout/study/party/relax activity contexts

5. **Popularity Bonus** (Weight: 1)
   - Rewards tracks with popularity > 70
   - Helps surface well-known tracks

**Scoring Formula:**
```
Score = (Track Similarity √ó 2, capped) + (Genre Match √ó 3) + (Mood Similarity √ó 3) + (Context Score √ó 2) + (Popularity Bonus √ó 1)
```

## üîç Track Analysis

The system analyzes selected reference tracks to understand user preferences:

- **Genre Extraction**: Automatically extracts genres from artist metadata
- **Artist Analysis**: Identifies artist patterns and preferences
- **Popularity Analysis**: Understands preferred popularity ranges
- **Mood Mapping**: Maps tracks to mood-based preferences
- **Context Matching**: Matches tracks to time and activity contexts

## üìä Evaluation Metrics

Built-in quality assessment includes:

- **Genre Coherence**: Measures how well genres flow together in recommendations
- **Popularity Smoothness**: Evaluates smoothness of popularity transitions
- **Genre Consistency**: Assesses consistency of genre selection

## üéµ How It Works

### User Interface Workflow
1. **Search Tracks**: Use the search bar to find songs, artists, or albums
2. **Select Reference Tracks**: Add tracks to your selection from search results
3. **Set Preferences**: Choose mood, time of day, and activity context
4. **Get Recommendations**: Click "Get Recommendations" to receive personalized suggestions
5. **Play Tracks**: Use the embedded Spotify player to preview recommendations

### Recommendation Engine - Step-by-Step Process

#### **Phase 1: Input Collection & Validation**
1. **User Input Gathering**
   - User selects tracks from Spotify search results
   - User optionally sets mood preferences (happy, sad, energetic, calm, romantic)
   - User optionally sets context (time of day: morning/afternoon/evening/night)
   - User optionally sets activity (workout/study/party/relax)

2. **Input Validation**
   - System validates that at least one track is selected before proceeding
   - If no tracks selected, shows error message and stops

#### **Phase 2: Authentication & Data Fetching**
3. **Spotify Authentication**
   - System obtains Spotify access token using client credentials flow
   - Uses `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` and `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` from environment variables

4. **Genre Extraction from Selected Tracks**
   - For each selected track, system fetches artist metadata from Spotify
   - Extracts all genres associated with each artist
   - Creates a comprehensive list of genres from all selected tracks
   - This helps understand the user's musical taste profile

#### **Phase 3: Search Query Generation**
5. **Multi-Query Strategy**
   - **Track-based queries**: Creates search queries using track names + artist names (up to 3)
   - **Genre-based queries**: Uses extracted genres from selected tracks (up to 3)
   - **Mood-based queries**: If mood is set, adds preferred genres for that mood (up to 2)
   - Example: If user selected "Bohemian Rhapsody" and mood is "energetic", queries might include:
     - "Bohemian Rhapsody Queen" (track-based)
     - "rock" (genre-based)
     - "electronic dance" (mood-based)

#### **Phase 4: Track Discovery**
6. **Parallel Track Fetching**
   - Executes all search queries simultaneously using `Promise.all()`
   - Each query returns up to 20 tracks from Spotify
   - Handles API failures gracefully (continues with successful queries)

7. **Deduplication**
   - Removes duplicate tracks based on Spotify track ID
   - Ensures each unique track appears only once in the candidate pool

#### **Phase 5: Track Scoring & Ranking**
8. **Metadata Enrichment**
   - For each candidate track, fetches artist metadata to get genre information
   - Builds comprehensive `TrackMetadata` objects with:
     - Track ID, title, artist, genre
     - Popularity score, release year, album name

9. **Multi-Factor Scoring System**
   The system calculates a score for each track using weighted factors:

   **a) Genre Match (Weight: 3)**
   - +3 points if track genre matches any extracted genre from selected tracks

   **b) Selected Track Similarity (Weight: 2, capped at 2)**
   - Artist similarity (50% weight): Checks if artist names contain each other
   - Title similarity (30% weight): Compares track titles with fuzzy matching
   - Popularity similarity (20% weight): Compares popularity scores
   - Applies penalty for remix/cover versions (multiplies by 0.7)

   **c) Mood Similarity (Weight: 3)**
   - Maps mood to preferred genres and popularity ranges:
     - Happy: pop, dance, electronic, indie-pop (60-100 popularity)
     - Sad: indie, folk, acoustic, alternative (20-80 popularity)
     - Energetic: rock, electronic, dance, hip-hop, metal (40-100 popularity)
     - Calm: ambient, classical, jazz, acoustic, chill (10-70 popularity)
     - Romantic: r&b, soul, jazz, acoustic, indie, pop, folk (30-90 popularity)
   - +3 points for good mood match, -1.5 points for poor mood match

   **d) Context Scoring (Weight: 2)**
   - **Time of Day**: Different genres preferred for morning/afternoon/evening/night
   - **Activity**: Different genres preferred for workout/study/party/relax
   - Combines both factors with 60% time weight, 40% activity weight

   **e) Popularity Bonus (Weight: 1)**
   - +1 point for tracks with popularity > 70

#### **Phase 6: Filtering & Finalization**
10. **Quality Filtering**
    - Removes selected tracks from recommendations (no self-recommendations)
    - Deduplicates by title + artist combination
    - Sorts by calculated score (highest first)

11. **Result Limiting**
    - Returns top 20 recommendations maximum
    - Ensures manageable result set for user interface

#### **Phase 7: Evaluation & Response**
12. **Quality Metrics Calculation**
    - **Genre Coherence**: Ratio of dominant genre in recommendations
    - **Popularity Smoothness**: How smoothly popularity varies across recommendations
    - **Genre Consistency**: Diversity ratio of genres in recommendations

13. **API Response**
    - Returns recommendations with scores
    - Includes evaluation metrics for quality assessment
    - Provides search strategy and query information for debugging
    - Shows total tracks found and extracted genres

### Key Features of the Engine:

- **Multi-signal approach**: Combines track similarity, mood, context, and popularity
- **Fuzzy matching**: Handles variations in artist names and track titles
- **Context awareness**: Considers time of day and activity for better recommendations
- **Quality control**: Removes duplicates and applies penalties for remixes/covers
- **Parallel processing**: Efficiently fetches data from multiple sources simultaneously
- **Graceful degradation**: Continues working even if some API calls fail
- **Evaluation metrics**: Provides feedback on recommendation quality
