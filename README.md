## üßÆ Scoring Algorithm

The recommendation system uses a balanced multi-factor scoring approach that prioritizes track similarity and user preferences:

1. **Track Similarity** (Weight: 4) - **Highest Priority**
   - Artist similarity matching (50% weight)
   - Title similarity scoring (30% weight)
   - Popularity similarity (20% weight)
   - Compares against all selected reference tracks

2. **Genre Matching** (Weight: 3)
   - Matches against genres extracted from selected tracks
   - Auto-extracts genres from artist metadata
   - Rewards tracks with matching genres

3. **Mood-based Scoring** (Weight: 3)
   - Genre matching based on mood preferences
   - Popularity range matching for mood context
   - Mood-specific genre and popularity combinations

4. **Context Awareness** (Weight: 2)
   - Time of day scoring (60% weight)
   - Activity-based scoring (40% weight)
   - Considers morning/afternoon/evening/night preferences
   - Matches workout/study/party/relax activity contexts

5. **Popularity Bonus** (Weight: 1)
   - Rewards tracks with popularity > 70
   - Helps surface well-known tracks

**Scoring Formula:**
```
Score = (Track Similarity √ó 4) + (Genre Match √ó 3) + (Mood Similarity √ó 3) + (Context Score √ó 2) + (Popularity Bonus √ó 1)
```

## üîç Track Analysis

The system analyzes selected reference tracks to understand user preferences:

- **Genre Extraction**: Automatically extracts genres from artist metadata
- **Artist Analysis**: Identifies artist patterns and preferences
- **Popularity Analysis**: Understands preferred popularity ranges
- **Mood Mapping**: Maps tracks to mood-based preferences
- **Context Matching**: Matches tracks to time and activity contexts

## üìä Evaluation Metrics

Built-in quality assessment includes:

- **Genre Coherence**: Measures how well genres flow together in recommendations
- **Popularity Smoothness**: Evaluates smoothness of popularity transitions
- **Genre Consistency**: Assesses consistency of genre selection

## üéµ How It Works

### User Interface Workflow
1. **Search Tracks**: Use the search bar to find songs, artists, or albums
2. **Select Reference Tracks**: Add tracks to your selection from search results
3. **Set Preferences**: Choose mood, time of day, and activity context
4. **Get Recommendations**: Click "Get Recommendations" to receive personalized suggestions
5. **Play Tracks**: Use the embedded Spotify player to preview recommendations

### Backend Processing
1. **Track Selection**: Users search and select reference tracks using the built-in search interface
2. **Genre Extraction**: System automatically extracts genres from selected tracks' artist metadata
3. **Search Query Generation**: Creates multiple search queries based on:
   - Selected track names and artists
   - Extracted genres from reference tracks
4. **Track Discovery**: Fetches tracks from multiple Spotify API searches and removes duplicates
5. **Multi-Factor Scoring**: Applies scoring algorithm considering:
   - Track similarity to reference tracks
   - Genre matching with extracted genres
   - Mood-based preferences
   - Context awareness (time of day, activity)
   - Popularity bonuses
6. **Filtering**: Removes selected reference tracks from recommendations
7. **Ranking**: Sorts recommendations by calculated scores (rounded to 2 decimal places)
8. **Evaluation**: Calculates quality metrics for assessment

## üé® Mood Support

The system supports mood-based recommendations with predefined mappings:

- **Happy**: Pop, dance, electronic, indie-pop (popularity 60-100)
- **Sad**: Indie, folk, acoustic, alternative (popularity 20-80)
- **Energetic**: Rock, electronic, dance, hip-hop, metal (popularity 40-100)
- **Calm**: Ambient, classical, jazz, acoustic, chill (popularity 10-70)

## üèÜ Project Requirements

‚úÖ **Stateless API**: No user tracking or data persistence  
‚úÖ **Track Selection Input**: Accepts selected reference tracks for recommendations  
‚úÖ **External Data Sources**: Integrates with Spotify API for search and metadata  
‚úÖ **Evaluation Strategy**: Built-in quality metrics for recommendation assessment  
‚úÖ **RESTful Design**: Standard HTTP methods and responses  
‚úÖ **Better than Random**: Sophisticated multi-factor scoring algorithm  
‚úÖ **Search Functionality**: Built-in track search interface  
‚úÖ **Context Awareness**: Time of day and activity-based recommendations

    }
  })
});

const data = await response.json();
console.log(data.recommendations);
```

### Search for Tracks
```javascript
const searchResponse = await fetch('/api/search', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query: 'The Beatles'
  })
});

const searchData = await searchResponse.json();
console.log(searchData.tracks);
```

### Test the API
```bash
# Test recommendations with selected tracks
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/recommend \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "selectedTracks": [
      {
        "id": "4iV5W9uYEdYUVa79Axb7Rh",
        "name": "Song Name",
        "artists": [{"name": "Artist Name"}],
        "album": {"name": "Album Name"},
        "popularity": 80
      }
    ],
    "preferences": {
      "mood": "happy"
    }
  }'

# Test search functionality
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "The Beatles"}'
```
