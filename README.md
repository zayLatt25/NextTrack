      "activity": "relax"
    }
  }
}
```

### GET `/api/recommend?action=evaluate`

Get evaluation metrics and test data for testing the recommendation system.

## üßÆ Scoring Algorithm

The recommendation system uses a multi-factor scoring approach with the following weights:

1. **Genre Transition Probability** (Weight: 4)
   - Analyzes genre transitions in listening history
   - Predicts most likely next genre based on patterns

2. **Popularity Progression** (Weight: 3)
   - Ensures smooth popularity transitions
   - Maintains consistent listening level based on trends

3. **Artist Transition** (Weight: 3)
   - Tracks artist patterns in listening history
   - Maintains artist flow consistency

4. **User Preferences** (Weight: 2)
   - Genre preferences matching
   - Mood-based genre and popularity matching
   - Title similarity scoring

5. **Artist Diversity** (Weight: 1)
   - Encourages variety when needed
   - Prevents repetitive artist sequences

## üîç Sequence Analysis

The system analyzes listening patterns to understand user behavior:

- **Genre Transitions**: Tracks how genres flow together in listening history
- **Artist Transitions**: Monitors artist patterns and transitions over time
- **Popularity Trends**: Analyzes popularity progression and smoothness
- **Release Year Trends**: Tracks temporal patterns in music selection
- **Artist Diversity**: Measures variety in artist selection

## üìä Evaluation Metrics

Built-in quality assessment includes:

- **Genre Coherence**: Measures how well genres flow together in recommendations
- **Popularity Smoothness**: Evaluates smoothness of popularity transitions
- **Genre Consistency**: Assesses consistency of genre selection

## üéµ How It Works

1. **Input Processing**: Validates listening history and preferences
2. **History Analysis**: Fetches metadata for all tracks in listening history
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Analyzes genre, artist, and popularity patterns
4. **Track Discovery**: Searches for similar tracks using Spotify API
5. **Scoring**: Applies multi-factor scoring algorithm
6. **Ranking**: Sorts recommendations by calculated scores
7. **Evaluation**: Calculates quality metrics for assessment

## üé® Mood Support

The system supports mood-based recommendations with predefined mappings:

- **Happy**: Pop, dance, electronic, indie-pop (popularity 60-100)
- **Sad**: Indie, folk, acoustic, alternative (popularity 20-80)
- **Energetic**: Rock, electronic, dance, hip-hop, metal (popularity 40-100)
- **Calm**: Ambient, classical, jazz, acoustic, chill (popularity 10-70)

## üèÜ Project Requirements

‚úÖ **Stateless API**: No user tracking or data persistence  
‚úÖ **Listening History Input**: Accepts sequence of track identifiers  
‚úÖ **External Data Sources**: Integrates with Spotify API  
‚úÖ **Evaluation Strategy**: Built-in quality metrics  
‚úÖ **RESTful Design**: Standard HTTP methods and responses  
‚úÖ **Better than Random**: Sophisticated multi-factor scoring algorithm

  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    listeningHistory: ['4iV5W9uYEdYUVa79Axb7Rh', '3n3Ppam7vgaVa1iaRUmn9T'],
    preferences: {
      preferredGenres: ['pop', 'indie'],
      mood: 'happy'

const data = await response.json();
console.log(data.recommendations);
```

### Test the API
```bash
# Test basic functionality
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/recommend \
